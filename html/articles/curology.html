            If there's one thing all — well, most — of us can agree on, it's
            that 10-step skin care routines are so pre-pandemic. If you're
            aiming to get in the less-is-more spirit this year, Curology may be
            your answer. For those looking to do a skin care detox this January,
            we tested out Curology's services and products to see if the brand
            lives up to its hype.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Curology is known for their personalized prescription formulas,
            which are prescription creams that are made for you under the
            guidance of a licensed dermatology provider. You'll take a survey
            that asks you about your skin type, skin concerns, medical history,
            and skin goals, then snap images of your skin for review by a
            licensed medical provider. Shortly after, you'll receive details on
            your personalized prescription formula. Plus, Curology provides
            additional tips for changes to make in your routine for max
            benefits. If you're after something to smooth away fine lines, fade
            dark spots, or put your acne era in the rear-view mirror, Curology's
            personalized prescription formulas have clinically-proven
            ingredients to help make it happen. You can also choose to add on
            products like moisturizers, cleansers, and acne spot patches that
            work in harmony with your personalized prescription formula, making
            it straightforward to care for your skin like a pro.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Beyond a personalized skin protocol, you'll love Curology because
            the active ingredients for your skin are concentrated into one
            formula. (No more fussing over which products to apply when, or
            wondering if your latest face serum is actually working.) All you
            have to do is follow your licensed dermatology provider's
            instructions on applying your personalized formula, and round out
            your routine with a gentle cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF 30
            sunscreen.

            <img

          </div>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The process begins with a simple survey that asks you questions
            about your skin, as well as pertinent medical information like
            medications you take, allergies, and medical conditions. You'll also
            answer questions about your skin type, then select your top skin
            concerns such as acne, dark spots, wrinkles, clogged pores, redness
            or rosacea, skin texture, and firmness. (Fear not, you can choose
            multiple concerns.) After you've completed the quiz, Curology will
            prompt you to upload three images of your face, one front view, one
            of the left side of your face, and one of the right. Remember to
            take off any makeup before taking the photos. These images, along
            with all the information you submit, are safely and securely stored.
            Your medical provider will review the images, your medical history,
            and your skin concerns to identify which ingredients to include in
            your personalized prescription formula.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            After reviewing your questionnaire and images, you'll get a message
            via the secure website with all the details on your personalized
            prescription formula, including the strengths of each ingredient
            your medical provider selects. You can choose to add on additional
            products. Your simplified skin care routine should arrive within 7
            to 10 days.

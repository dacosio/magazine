            With all this publicity, you may have wondered if this program could
            work for you. Before you jump into the “box” (ahem, that’s CrossFit
            speak for gym), here’s what you need to know about the workout craze
            — and how to determine if it's right for you.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            As with any high intensity workout, there is some risk involved. One
            study found that 20 percent of the CrossFit participants surveyed
            injured themselves while doing CrossFit endorsed workouts.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            “The injury rate of CrossFit is about 20 percent, meaning 20 percent
            of people who perform CrossFit branded workouts regularly will be
            injured at some point, which is high for a recreational activity,"
            says Cuyler Hudson, a physical therapist at Finish Line. "I
            personally see CrossFitters regularly in my physical therapy
            practice. Injuries will usually occur as an athlete fatigues, which
            causes their form to also fatigue, causing the load to be shifted
            from the areas it is supposed to be to areas that cannot handle the
            stress as well.”

            A form of high intensity interval training, CrossFit is a strength
            and conditioning workout that is made up of functional movement
            performed at a high intensity level.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            These movements are actions that you perform in your day-to-day
            life, like squatting, pulling, pushing etc. Many workouts feature
            variations of squats, push-ups, and weight lifting that last for
            predetermined amounts of time to help build muscles. This varies
            from a traditional workout that may tell you how many reps to do
            over any period of time.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            CrossFit Journal notes that the workouts are so effective because of
            their emphasis on the elements of load, distance and speed, which
            help participants develop high levels of power. The workout may
            utilize different equipment to accomplish this, including kettle
            bells, rowers and bikes, medicine balls, speed ropes, rings and plyo
            boxes.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            CrossFit is similar to Orange Theory in that there is a standard
            "workout of the day" (WOD) that all members complete on the same
            day. The daily workout can be found on their website (which is
            always free), along with a guide to all the specialized lingo that
            is used. There is also a substitutions section on their FAQ page
            that suggests places to find level appropriate workouts. “CrossFit
            is universally scalable and modifiable for all fitness levels, so it
            can be tailored to meet your goals and current fitness level,” says
            Tracey Magee, owner and head coach of CrossFit Clan Performance
            Center.

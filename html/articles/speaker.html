          <h2>SONOS ERA 100 IS A COMPACT, SMART-AND PERFECT-SPEAKER</h2>

            I’VE NEVER REALLY admired Sonos' speakers for their actual sound
            quality. Sure, the prior Play One and Five series speakers, the
            company's soundbars, subwoofer, and even the portable Roam sound
            perfectly decent. But the main draw of a Sonos speaker is the
            technology behind the grill. Boasting integrations with Alexa,
            Apple, Google, and virtually every music streaming service worth
            mentioning, the multiroom-capable system is the most convenient way
            to listen to everything, everywhere, all at once.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            With the new Era 100, Sonos finally wipes the floor with competitors
            when it comes to sound quality too. With stereo tweeters and a more
            advanced room tuning feature, this is a single speaker that easily
            holds its own with everything but more expensive two-speaker
            systems. If you're in the market for a compact all-in-one speaker,
            the Era 100 is easily the best one I have ever heard. I would
            happily spread them around my home like wildflowers if I was
            shopping for a way to fill my home with sound.

            Beyond a personalized skin protocol, you'll love Curology because
            the active ingredients for your skin are concentrated into one
            formula. (No more fussing over which products to apply when, or
            wondering if your latest face serum is actually working.) All you
            have to do is follow your licensed dermatology provider's
            instructions on applying your personalized formula, and round out
            your routine with a gentle cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF 30
            sunscreen.

            The Era 100 looks familiar. It matches the second-generation Sonos
            One and One SL speakers in both size and shape. This makes sense,
            given that the previous models already had a sleek design that
            easily blends into most rooms, and given that Sonos is dedicated to
            keeping its previous products relevant, both visually and
            technologically, for years and years.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Sonos also recently released the Era 300, a new Dolby Atmos speaker
            that is larger and more expensive. The Era 300 replaces the Sonos
            Play:3, which was discontinued before this revamp. Those speakers
            are still supported, but it's worth noting that the company
            previously got in a bit of hot water over discontinuing support for
            other early models. That said, technology for smart speakers has
            come a long way since those early models Sonos was forced to
            mothball, and in my experience, the company does its best to keep
            its products functioning for as long as possible. Later-gen Sonos
            speakers all still work fantastically together.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The rectangular Era 100 speaker comes in black or white. It has a
            volume slider on top, as well as a play-pause button, so you don’t
            have to pull out your phone to do the simple stuff. The slider is a
            welcome change that many users reportedly asked for. The speaker has
            a rubbery foot that means it will stick to nearly any surface you
            place it on. For those who dislike voice assistants, there's a
            switch on the back of the speaker, alongside its USB-C input, that
            lets you physically disable the built-in microphone.

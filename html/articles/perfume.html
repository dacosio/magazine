            HENRY Balance BUY $125.00 JACK HENRY Before we go into how I feel
            about this fragrance, here are all the need-to-know details: Its top
            notes are bergamot, mandarin, and aqua. Middle notes are cedarwood,
            jasmine, and vetiver, and the base notes are amber, patchouli, and
            musk. Okay...but what does that all mean? It means that Jack Henry
            Balance's scent gets lighter the more you smell it.

            It starts off with a lot of that mandarin (almost overwhelmingly so)
            until it starts to taper off to that refreshing and light bergamot
            and aqua. Once it dries, it gets really sharp — very minty. After a
            few hours, the base notes come through, and there's more of that
            heavy (but relaxing) scent that comes with musk and patchouli — but
            still, it never gets too heavy. It's balanced (no pun intended) with
            a bit of sweetness from the amber. In other words, its elegance is
            balanced with subtle enough notes that it works for everyday life.

            I have a very sensitive nose, yet I love fragrances. I'm always
            looking to smell good without feeling overwhelmed and giving myself
            a headache. Fresh scents are my absolute favorites, but a lot of
            them end up smelling more feminine than masculine. Jack Henry's
            Balance is the exception. It's musky and heavy enough to come across
            as masculine while maintaining that air of freshness and sweetness
            that I absolutely love. My favorite fragrance of all time is
            DedCool's Milk, and it just so happens that a few notes from that
            are in Balance — bergamot and amber.

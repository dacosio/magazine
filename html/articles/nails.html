          <h2>7 NAIL ART TRENDS BUDDING THIS SPRING</h2>

            The art of the manicure is all about experimentation. In the new
            year, maybe you got into shaping and painting your nails at home in
            an attempt to save money. It's possible that TikTok influenced you
            to try the red-nail theory that had many of us wearing (and
            considering the subliminal messaging of) Big Apple Red.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            This spring, there are more trends to try. Given the state of the
            economy, it stands to reason that many of us will be DIYing the
            designs, trying a hand (literally) at a micro French or just a
            simple, single color manicure. Here, we give you a mix, so whether
            you're heading to a salon or painting your nails at home —
            realistically, you'll do both this season — here are some ideas to
            inspire.

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            For spring, we're seeing mirrored metallic nails swing back into the
            trend sphere. Kim Truong, an L.A.-based nail artist, says this will
            be less of a glazed-donut vibe, and more colorful. "More intense
            than a glaze, metallic can be achieved in bright colors which will
            be perfect for the summer," says Truong. Opt for a fun base tone —
            like this deep teal — and then add the white chrome powder to make
            it metallic.

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            On TikTok, one of the new trends is the "milky" manicure. What makes
            a manicure dairy-like? Your nail polish color should be a white or
            on the white-pink spectrum (more strawberry milk) and it should be
            opaque but still glossy. You can do a milky French, adding a thin
            white tip, or just keep the neutral milky tone on its own. Here,
            Truong uses a Japanese gel polish, but you can get the same tone
            with CND Romantique, Glosslab OG Everyday, or DazzleDry Starry Eyed

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            If you're looking for something brighter, try neon orange. "For
            festival season, I'm expecting to see colorful, neon shades," offers
            Truong. "A trick to making your neon polish really pop is to apply
            white underneath." In this example from Paintbucket, we're seeing an
            interpretation of the "aura" or "blooming gel" manicure with a
            neutral pink-nude base and and large tangerine ombré orb at the
            center of each nail.

            />
          </div>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            If you have yet to try the mismatched manicure — your left hand has
            one design or color and the right gets another — spring is the time
            to try it. If you're into press-on nails and have a few boxes at
            home, mix two different designs in the same manicure. Or, you can
            just use regular polish. A green and blue, maybe. Or, a peach and
            yellow, as seen in this example by Chillhouse. Given that we're
            heading into a new season with many transitions ahead, this is a
            perfect design to keep in your 'Saved' folder.

            Truong predicts that tones of sheer pink will be popular as we move
            from winter into spring. Truong recently told R29 how to achieve
            this look: Mix a solid pink color with a clear top coat, which will
            make the polish more translucent, or gossamer, like the lip gloss
            aesthetic. A big plus: This style can act as a reset when you've
            been wearing chrome-dusted nails and you want something less
            shimmery but not totally bare.

            Pearlescent polish plus 3D gel, gives us the jellied oyster nail art
            trend. It's subtle, but if you look closely here — this nail art by
            Los Angeles artist Mary Grace Koh — you'll notice that a few
            fingernails have these raised, semi-amorphous droplets. It's a
            Korean nail-art trend, so if you're looking for something similar,
            I'd recommend seeking out a Korean nail salon or studio in your
            area.

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Instead of wearing the same design across all ten fingers, combine a
            few different colors and designs (we're partial to navy and pearl)
            for a take on the aforementioned mismatched manicure, a trend that
            will continue to feel fresh into summer.

          <h2>Micro French</h2>

            According to Rachel Glass, the founder of NYC-started salon brand,
            Glosslab (with new locations in Connecticut, D.C., Miami, and soon
            Dallas), the French manicure continues to hold a title as the most
            popular nail art, across cities. However, the new update is a micro
            French. "The thinner line of this micro French mani is super subtle
            and chic," Glass offers.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The micro French is not a new trend, but we love when it cycles
            through for a few reasons: it's minimalist, you can bring in any
            color you're into at the moment (black is fresh), and it looks great
            on short nails

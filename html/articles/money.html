            One of the best ways to take charge of your finances in today's
            uncertain economy is to accumulate a healthy savings account. Nobody
            wants to feel the stress of knowing that they are only a paycheck or
            two away from financial disaster because they lack money to fall
            back on when “stuff happens.” Specific examples include job loss,
            disability, a car breakdown, a sick child or pet, and other types of
            financial emergencies. Saving provides a financial “backstop” for
            life's uncertainties and increases feelings of security and peace of
            mind. Once an adequate emergency fund is established, savings can
            also provide the “seed money” for higher-yielding investments such
            as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            There is also evidence from a recent study by the Northwestern
            Mutual insurance company that savings is linked to increased
            happiness. Actually, what the study found was that people who are
            “planners” and do future-oriented things such as setting goals and
            taking steps (e.g., saving money) to achieve those goals feel
            happier, and better about their lives, than those who don't make
            plans. On a related note, the Consumer Federation of America found a
            strong relationship between having spending and saving plans and
            maintaining emergency funds. Particularly for low-income
            individuals, those with a spending plan with goals were far more
            likely to have saved money for emergencies than were those without a
            plan.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Economists and psychologists attribute findings like these to the
            sense of control that people have when they plan ahead and know what
            they need to do to get from where they are now to where they want to
            be. It is well established by research that people who feel a sense
            of control over life events are often happier, cope better, and are
            more resilient in times of stress than others. Conversely, people
            are especially unhappy in situations where they perceive themselves
            to have a lack of control. It is, therefore, no surprise that
            commuting ranks high on the list of things that make people most
            unhappy. Commuters never know from day to day what traffic gridlock,
            accidents, and weather-related hassles they'll encounter.

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Encouraging people to develop and implement a personal saving plan
            is the central focus of the America Saves program. The motto of
            America Saves is “Build Wealth, Not Debt.” 2009 also marks the third
            year of America Saves Week, an annual event that focuses attention
            on the benefits of saving. Throughout the country, there will be
            information and events designed to promote saving and to help
            individual savers develop a personal action plan. The dates for
            America Saves Week 2009 are February 22 to March 1.

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            America Saves is an example of a “social marketing campaign.” This
            means that the messages associated with this program are designed to
            change people's behavior rather than to sell them a product or
            service, as is typical with most marketing messages. Just like the
            “Buckle Up for Safety” campaign several decades ago that got many
            people in the habit of wearing seat belts, America Saves seeks to
            get more Americans into the savings habit to improve their future
            financial security and that of the country.
